# CSCI2000 Scientific Data Analysis Final Project
## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ramontanoeiro/student-performance/data

This report examines the dataset listed above, and we use numorous tools anf methods to derive conclusions from this data. 
The dataset displays Portuguese secondary students and different factors which might affect their academic progress. 
We closely examined the number of hours spent studying, number of absences, parental education, if the student was tutored, and commute times.

Our analysis of the data showed us, the most successful student in our dataset follows many of our hypotheses, such as studying for many
hours a week, having highly educated parents, commuting the minimal amount. 

Using our analysis of this data, we can apply it to improve quality of life for a student who is performing
poorly in school. It gives a confidence boost to those students, showing them there is an academic future
for them. For students who are not academically inclined it opens up a plethora of career paths, an
important decision we all have to make in life. Perhaps allowing them to pursue a career they otherwise
might have not.
